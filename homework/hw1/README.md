## Homework1

This is all the information for CS189 24Fall homework1.

The hw1 folder contains the **tex template**, **pdf file** and **dataset** for question 7. These contents are public on the cs189 course website, but UCB does not disclose the answer to the homework. Since question 7 is a python programming question, I copied the text of question 7 to Jupyter notebook and created a **hw1.ipynb**, but there is no auto grader.

The hw1_waz folder contains my completed homework for reference.
